Our project aims to conduct an exploratory analysis of the Bachelor/Bachelorette franchise, the wildly popular reality dating show that has been airing since 2002. Over 6-10 weeks, each season narrows an initial group of ~30 contestants through Rose Ceremonies, during which the Bachelor/Bachelorette chooses which contestants to bring to the next round. Throughout each week, the Bachelor/Bachelorette can also grant special roses to contestants, such as group date roses or first impression roses. At the end of the season, the Bachelor/Bachelorette is expected to get engaged to the final contestant. Each week, producers carefully curate an entertaining, dramatic portrayal of the Bachelor/Bachelorette’s journey to love, while viewers at home tune into each episode with nervous anticipation. Throughout the 26 seasons of “The Bachelor” and 19 seasons of “The Bachelorette,” fans have predicted many different potential determinants/indicators of a winning contestant (e.g. screen time, reception of first impression rose).

## Data sets
### contestant-data-simplified-1.csv 
This dataset consists of basic demographic and show-related information for each contestant over each season, including the show, season, name, whether they won, whether they were a runner up, elimination week, whether they received a first impression rose, occupation, hometown, age, total roses received, and number of contestants in their elimination week. 
We cleaned and merged data sets from the official Bachelor Nation Wiki, Kaggle, and fivethirtyeight.

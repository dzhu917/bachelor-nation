							<h4>✨The Bigger Picture: Our Entire Contestant Line-Up✨</h4>
							<p>To the right, we've represented each contestant as a dot. The green ones represent Bachelor contestants,
								and the pink ones represent Bachelorette contestants. Each cluster contains one season of contestants.</p>
							<br>
							<h4>Toggle over each contestant to find out more about them!</h4>

								<h4>🏆And The Winner Is...🏆</h4>
								<p>Winners in each season (i.e. the contestant selected by the Bachelor/Bachelorette at the end
									of the season are differentiated by size. Interestingly, Bachelor Season 11 did not have a winner! During the final rose ceremony, Brad Womack became the first bachelor
									in the history of the show to reject every contestant.</p>
							</div>

					<section class="step">
						<h4>🤷Contestant Elimination🤷</h4>
						<p>Contestants are eliminated each week, as the Bachelor/Bachelorette develops deeper relationships.
							We've indicated elimination week through color here: the lighter the color of the dot, the earlier
						the contestant was eliminated. Winners, therefore, are represented by the darkest dot in each cluster.</p>
					</section>

					<section class="step">
						<h4>⏬Trickle-Down Elimination⏬</h4>
						<p>Here, contestants are sorted based on elimination week — as you can see, contestants are eliminated week by week
						until only one contestant remains. This winner gets engaged to the Bachelor(ette).</p>
						<br>
						<h4>Click on any contestant to learn more about each season!</h4>
						<p>You'll see a horizontal timeline of the season (from left to right),
							showing when each contestant was eliminated.</p>

					<section class="step">
						<h4>🌹First impression roses as an indicator of success🌹</h4>
						<p>In the first week of each season, one contestant received a "First Impression Rose". We've compiled contestants
							across all Bachelor and Bachelorette seasons by whether they received a first impression rose.</p>
						<h4>Drag the slider to view the elimination status of contestants for each week of the show.</h4>
						<div id="slider"></div>
						<p>Out of all Bachelor and Bachelorette seasons, 26 first impression roses were given out. Of the contestants
							who received a first impression rose, 7 (27%) of them would go on to win the show. In contrast,
							only 26 out of the 860 (3%) other contestants that have been on the show ultimately won their season.</p>
					</section>

					<section class="step">
						<h4>🤝Winners vs. Runner-ups🤝</h4>
						<p>Only one contestant each season can be crowned a winner and get engaged to the Bachelor(ette).
						The show depicts the choice between the final two contestants as heart-wrenching
						and nearly impossible because of the depth of both relationships. What makes and breaks this choice? 
						Do the paths of winners and runner-ups really differ from each other?</p>
						<p>In the graphic, the top dot represents the winner and the bottom dot represents the runner-up</p>
						<div id="ru-intro-legend"></div>

						<p>*In Season 11, there was a tie; the Bachelor chose neither of the final 2 contestants!</p>
					</section>

					<section class="step">
						<h4>🥀First Impressions Matter for the Bachelorette🥀</h4>
						<p>The winner or runner-up had received a first impression rose across 11 seasons of the show. Of these seasons, the first impression
							rose mattered most for the Bachelorette, where 5 out of 6 winners chosen had the first impression rose, as compared to the Bachelor
							where only 2 out of 5 winners had the first impression rose.</p>
						<br>
						<p>In other words, first-impression roses make a difference more so on the Bachelorette!</p>
						<div id="ru-fir-legend"></div>
					</section>

					<section class="step">
						<h4>💞Winners Go On More Dates💞</h4>
						<p>Most winners and runner-ups go on similar numbers of dates, explaining why the choice between the final two contestants is so difficult.
							But they help! There are only five seasons (across all Bachelor and Bachelorette
						seasons) during which runner ups went on more dates than winners.</p>
						<br>
						<p>In other words, it seems like the number of dates matters. Winners tend to go on more dates!</p>

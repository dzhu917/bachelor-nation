							<h4>✨The Bigger Picture: Our Entire Contestant Line-Up✨</h4>
							<p>To the right, we've represented each contestant as a dot. The blue ones represent Bachelor contestants,
								and the orange ones represent Bachelorette contestants. Each cluster contains one season of contestants.</p>

							<h4>Toggle over each contestant to find out more about them!</h4>

								<h4>🏆And The Winner Is...🏆</h4>
								<p>Winners in each season (i.e. the contestant selected by the Bachelor/Bachelorette at the end
									of the season are differentiated by size. Interestingly, Bachelor Season 11 did not have a winner! During the final rose ceremony, Brad Womack became the first bachelor
									in the history of the show to reject every contestant.</p>

					<section class="step">
						<h4>🤷Contestant Elimination🤷</h4>
						<p>Contestants are eliminated each week, as the Bachelor/Bachelorette develops deeper relationships.
							We've indicated elimination week through color here: the lighter the color of the dot, the earlier
						the contestant was eliminated. Winners, therefore, are represented by the darkest dot in each cluster.</p>
					</section>

					<section class="step">
						<h4>⏬Trickle-Down Elimination⏬</h4>
						<p>Here, contestants are sorted based on elimination week — as you can see, contestants are eliminated week by week
						until only one contestant remains. This winner gets engaged to the Bachelor(ette).</p>
						<br>
						<h4>Learn more about each season by clicking on any contestant.</h4>
						<p>You'll see a horizontal timeline of the season (from left to right),
							showing when each contestant was eliminated.</p>

						<h4>🌹First impression roses as an indicator of success🌹</h4>
						<p>In the first week of each season, one contestant received a "First Impression Rose".</p>
						<p>Out of all Bachelor and Bachelorette seasons, 26 first impression roses were given out. Of the contestants
							who received a first impression rose, 7 (27%) of them would go on to win the show. In contrast,
							only 26 out of the 860 (3%) other contestants that have been on the show ultimately won their season</p>
						<div id="slider"></div>

					<section class="step">
						<h4>🤝Runner-ups vs. Winners🤝</h4>
						<p>In each season, only one contestant can be crowned a winner (i.e. get engaged to the Bachelor(ette).
						The show usually depicts the Bachelor(ette)'s choice between the final two contestants as heart-wrenching
						and nearly impossible, because of how deep both relationships have become.</p>
						<p>If the runner-ups and winners are really so difficult to choose between, how do their paths differ
							from each other? Is there any way to predict who will win and who will come in second place?</p>
						<h4>For each season, we're focusing only on winners and runner-ups: winner on top, runner-up on bottom.</h4>
						<p>In Season 11, there was a tie (the last two remaining contestants were both eiminated)!</p>
					</section>

					<section class="step">
						<h4>🥀First-Impression Roses: Do they make a difference?🥀</h4>
						<p>We've marked first-impression rose receivers in red. As you can see, there were only 4 seasons (across all Bachelor
							and Bachelorette seasons) during which runner-ups received first-impression roses. On the other hand, there were 7 seasons in which
							winners received first-impression roses.</p>
						<br>
						<p>In other words, first-impression roses do seem to make a difference!</p>
					</section>

					<section class="step">
						<h4>💞Number of Dates: Do they make a difference?💞</h4>
						<p>The size of each contestant circle has been changed based on the number of dates. The larger
						the circle, the more dates the contestant has been on. There are only five seasons (across all Bachelor and Bachelorette
						seasons) during which runner ups went on more dates than winners.</p>
						<br>
						<p>In other words, it seems like the number of dates matters. Winners tend to go on more dates!</p>

				<h1>Bachelor Nation: Visualized</h1>
			</div>
			<p style="line-height: 1.7">If you've been on social media or watch TV, you've probably heard of ABC's Bachelor
				franchise. Every season, one person is crowned the Bachelor or Bachelorette, and a group of contestants
				vie for their love by going on dates throughout the season. Contestants are eliminated every week
				at rose ceremonies, during which the Bachelor(ette) grants a rose to contestants chosen
				to move forward.</p>
			<br>
			<p style="line-height: 1.7">The franchise has run for a while — the Bachelor has 21 seasons, and
				the Bachelorette has 13. With hundreds of contestants who have gone through this unconventional process
				of finding love, we wondered what a visualization of the franchise might look like. Who tends to win the
				Bachelor(ette)'s heart? Do first impression roses mean anything? We dove into the data behind the franchise, its
				contestants, and how it all pans out!

							<h4>The Big Picture: All Contestants</h4>
							<p>To the right, we've represented each contestant as a dot. The blue ones represent Bachelor contestants,

									of the season are differentiated by size. Interestingly, Bachelor Season 11 did not have a winner!</p>

						<h4>Contestant Elimination</h4>
						<p>Contestants are eliminated each week, as the Bachelor/Bachelorette develops deeper relationships.
							We've indicated elimination week through color here: the lighter the color of the dot, the earlier
						the contestant was eliminated. Winners, therefore, are represented by the darkest dot in each cluster.</p>
					</section>

					<section class="step">
						<h4>Trickle-Down Elimination</h4>
						<p>Here, contestants are sorted based on elimination week — as you can see, contestants are eliminated week by week
						until only one contestant remains. This winner gets engaged to the Bachelor(ette).</p>

						<p><b>Learn more about each season by clicking on any contestant.</b></p>

						<h4>First impression roses as an indicator of success</h4>
						<p>In the first week of each season, one contestant received a "First Impression Rose".</p>
						<p>Out of all Bachelor and Bachelorette seasons, 26 first impression roses were given out. Of the contestants
							who received a first impression rose, 7 (27%) of them would go on to win the show. In contrast,
							only 26 out of the 860 (3%) other contestants that have been on the show ultimately won their season</p>

						<h4>Runner-ups vs. Winners</h4>
						<p>In each season, only one contestant can be crowned a winner (i.e. get engaged to the Bachelor(ette).
						The show usually depicts the Bachelor(ette)'s choice between the final two contestants as heart-wrenching
						and nearly impossible, because of how deep both relationships have become.</p>
						<p>If the runner-ups and winners are really so difficult to choose between, how do their paths differ
							from each other? Is there any way to predict who will win and who will come in second place?</p>
						<h4>For each season, we're focusing only on winners and runner-ups: winner on top, runner-up on bottom.</h4>
						<p>In Season 11, there was a tie!</p>

						<h4>Number of Dates: Do they make a difference?</h4>
						<p>The size of each contestant circle has been changed based on the number of dates. The larger
